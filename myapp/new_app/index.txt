Git sparse checkout allows you to work on just a section of the repository covered by git, however even when you use a sparse checkout, it is only the checkout that is sparse, the entire repository with all its history. A git sparse checkout therefore only solves part of the problem, and certainly it prevents the developer from accidentally working on an unintended part of the repository hello123456.
